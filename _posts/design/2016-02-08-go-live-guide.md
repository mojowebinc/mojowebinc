A Go Live Guide is a list of key activities employees need to complete to have a successful Go Live. Like a roadmap or action plan, a Go Live Guide lists activities in sequence, but in greater detail. In addition, the Go Live Guide provides key contact information for support personnel and sources for self-help, such as an online resource center.
