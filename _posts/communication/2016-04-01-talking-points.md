### Manager Talking Points
The Manager Talking Points email is a regular communication that goes to all managers following the monthly steering committee meetings. They provide an important vehicle for providing consistent messaging about key project activities and accomplishments of the Stratus project. In addition, the Manager Talking Points email provides important information that managers should review with employees during formal meetings and informal conversations.

#### Town Hall Survey Results
##### Top Question: When is Go Live?
The most pressing concern on the minds of employees was the system Go Live date. In response, Project Sponsor noted: “At this point we have a detailed project plan of the remaining work. The plan is not without risks, particularly as you look at the volume of testing ahead of us. That said, the plan currently points to a Go Live this coming fall.”

#### What’s Happening on Project Stratus
<b>System Testing: Parallel System Testing Achieves Accuracy Criteria</b>
Results of our parallel testing have met our accuracy criteria for all departments areas. A final review is underway by COMPANYONE prior to sign-off.

<b>Change Management: The Stratus Roadshow Scheduled for End of July</b>
We are planning a Virtual Roadshow to discuss new system functions and a detailed timeline for upcoming activities. We are coordinating with the leadership team and HR from each location, who will contact you in the near future with more details.

#### What’s Changing for COMPANYONE?
<b>Employees to be Identified with CEN</b>
With the transition to NewSystem, employees will no longer be identified through their Social Security Number. Instead, employees will be identified through their COMPANYONE Employee Number (CEN) generated by NewSystem. We are working with impacted departments that rely on employee data and have a series of communications planned to inform employees of the change.
