<p>The Stratus project team would like to thank the employees who took part in the survey following our recent Town Hall event. Survey results were compiled and shared with the COMPANYONE and Stratus leadership teams. This bulletin summarizes the top questions COMPANYONE employees have about the Stratus project, and how the Stratus project team will address them.</p>

<p style="margin:0;"><b>Q. Why isn’t there a plan with a clear timeline, milestones and Go Live date?</b></p>
<p><i>A. Having a clear project timeline was the top question from employees, and is the greatest concern within the Stratus leadership team since it has such an impact on scheduling work and personal time. However, following our recent No-Go decision for two of our foreign subsidiaries, we decided to conduct an extensive review and internal audit of the project timeline. While we are making progress, we have not reached agreement on a final Go Live date. In the meantime, we are continuing with value added project activities, such as our system testing.</i></p>

<p style="margin:0;"><b>Q. Isn’t bringing all plants online at the same time (i.e., “The Big Bang) riskier than a “Waved” approach?</b></p>
<p><i>A. Big Bang and Waved approaches both involve risk. However, a Waved approach involves more risk for COMPANYONE due to due to the complexity of our current file transfer and consolidation processes. For example, consolidation of tax reporting information under a phased approach would require the added development of custom interfaces for each location and require running Legacy and NewSystem in parallel compromising our ability to meet reporting deadlines.</i></p>

<p style="margin:0;"><b>Q. Can we get more “hands on” classroom-based training at the plant level?</b></p>
<p><i>A. There is no substitute for “hands on” system experience and we are adjusting our training approach accordingly. For our end users, we will use a classroom based approach that offers hands on practice with NewSystem transactions. In addition, we are tailoring training materials according to the unique changes occurring at each location.</i></p>
