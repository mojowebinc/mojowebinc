### About Mojo-Web
Hi, I'm Jim Farrell, an independent consultant and creator of this website. I specialize in helping companies successfully implement strategic initiatives by strengthening change capability, enhancing communication and designing personalized learning experiences.

It’s been my good fortune to have enabled some really talented teams as they transformed their companies in pursuit of a strategic vision. Our most successful efforts occurred when best practice met the practical, resulting in an exceptional solutions.

Whether in education as an organizational psychologist or in practice as a consultant, I’ve maintained a passion for achieving a deeper understanding of social systems and strategic management. I have an equal passion for great music, independent film and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.


### About this website
This website was an exploration into developing responsive web pages using a “mobile first” design strategy. The pages, and works samples, were designed to display well on both mobile devices and desktops.

In addition, this is a “static website” with the pages generated by Jekyll prior to server deployment. Since the server doesn’t have to “build” the pages, there is less reliance on back end technologies to build and deliver the content, resulting in greater simplicity and speed.

Finally, all the development tools used to create this site were free and/or open source. I’m grateful to the communities that provided templates, online documentation and forums for trouble shooting. Below is a list of the main tools I used.
