### About Mojo-Web

Hi, I'm Jim Farrell, an independent consultant and creator of this website. I specialize in helping companies successfully implement strategic initiatives by strengthening change capability, enhancing communication and designing personalized learning experiences.

It’s been my good fortune to have enabled some really talented teams as they transformed their companies in pursuit of a strategic vision. Our most successful efforts occurred when best practice met the practical, resulting in an exceptional solutions.

Whether in education as an organizational psychologist or in practice as a consultant, I’ve maintained a passion for achieving a deeper understanding of social systems and strategic management. I share an equal passion for great music, independent film and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.
